# Requirements
## Introduction
An Automatic Washing Machine Console System program which is based on user inputs to choose from wide varities of different modes (fully-flexible) which takes care of the clothes for washing or drying. It also provides the power control for various motors and pumps controlling the driving motor spin duration and speed, with added features for analyzing the input physical parameters such as input voltage, load current for motor safety, increasing the system operation lifetime durability and safety.

## Research
### Automatic Washing Machine Control Systems
From the current available products under fully automatic mode are designed for the complete isolation of user intervention in the washing process.The system should provide all basic features of a washing machine like washing, rinsing, spinning, drying, cold wash, hot wash etc. Once the system is started in this mode it should perform its work independently and after the completion of work it should notify the user about the completion of work. This mode is designed to instantaneously sense cloth quantity and requirement of water, water temperature, detergent, load, wash cycle time and perform operation accordingly.

Also for the added safety, when the lid is open system should not work. If door is accidentally opened in between wash operation, then the system should stop working in minimum possible time. The system should work on single phase AC from 190VAC to 250VAC. The system should protect itself from power supply voltage variations. In the event of power failure, the washing machine should automatically start its cycle from the point of interruption when power is resumed.
A washing machine may have a System Controller (Brain of the System) which provides the power control for various monitors and pumps and even controls the display that tells us how the wash cycles are proceeding. System Controller reads the speed of motor and controls the speed of motor in different phases such as in Washing, Cleaning Drying etc. All kinds of Sensors such as Door Sensor, Pressure Sensor and Keypad, Speed sensor are also maintained by this. 

## Cost and Features
No. | Features | Cost
---|----------------------|-----------
 1 |  Manual Washing Machine Systems  | Rs.5,000 onwards
 2 | Semi-automatic Washing Machine Systems | Rs.10,000 onwards
 3 | Fully-automatic Washing Machine Systems | Rs.15,000 onwards

## Defining Our System
It is a user input based application for Automatic Washing Machine Console System program with different modes (fully-flexible) which takes care of the clothes for washing or drying. It also provides the power control for various motors and pumps controlling the driving motor spin duration and speed, with added features for analyzing the input physical parameters such as input voltage, load current for motor safety, increasing the system operation lifetime durability and safety.

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who

**User** Domestic or commercial user who needs to cut down on efforts and time, can easily utilize the process flow even for the easy management of laundary.

## What

**Product** Many high end systems provide these facilities but do not allow user to opt for fully flexible options to mould the system process flow as per their need and choice.

## When

**Active** The problem with automatic washing systems is that they do not offer user to opt for the level upto which they want the system to work.

## Where

The problem with automatic washing systems is that they do not offer user to opt for the level upto which they want the system to work.

## How

**Inputs** The fully automatic systems would offer effortless process flow with least user inputs but this is not required every time, it needs to posses full flexibility to be completely maneuvered.
